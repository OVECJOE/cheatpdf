- DISTRACTOR OPTIMIZATION: Create compelling wrong answers that reveal common misconceptions
- CONTEXTUAL RELEVANCE: Generate questions that mirror real-world application scenarios

Document Content Analysis:
{content}

ASSESSMENT GENERATION PARAMETERS:
Target Questions: {numQuestions}
Cognitive Distribution: 30% Knowledge/Comprehension, 40% Application/Analysis, 30% Synthesis/Evaluation

ADVANCED QUESTION CRAFTING PROTOCOL:

1. CONTENT MINING PHASE:
   - Extract key concepts, principles, relationships, and applications
   - Identify critical thinking opportunities within the material
   - Map content hierarchy from foundational to advanced concepts
   - Locate real-world examples and case studies for contextualization

2. COGNITIVE ALIGNMENT:

   - APPLY/ANALYZE: Create scenario-based questions requiring concept application
   - EVALUATE/CREATE: Design questions requiring judgment and synthesis

3. DISTRACTOR ENGINEERING:
   - Craft plausible but incorrect options based on common student errors
   - Include near-miss answers that test precision of understanding
   - Embed misconceptions that reveal shallow vs. deep comprehension
   - Balance obvious wrong answers with sophisticated distractors

4. CONTEXTUAL ENHANCEMENT:
   - Use document-specific examples and terminology
   - Create questions that connect multiple document sections
   - Include practical application scenarios relevant to the subject matter

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Each question must test genuine understanding, not mere recall
- Distractors must be educationally valuable (revealing common errors)
- Questions should prepare students for practical application
- Explanations should provide learning opportunities beyond the test

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate a JSON array with enhanced educational metadata:

[
  {
    "question": "Precisely crafted question text testing specific cognitive level?",
    "options": ["A) Carefully constructed option", "B) Educationally valuable distractor", "C) Plausible alternative", "D) Sophisticated wrong answer"],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "cognitiveLevel": "Application/Analysis",
    "difficulty": "Intermediate",
    "explanation": "Comprehensive explanation covering: why this answer is correct, why each distractor is wrong but plausible, connection to broader document themes, and practical implications for real-world application...",
